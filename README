HOW-TO-USE:
Just execute the "Program.py" file using Python intepreter. There will be four options available for TA to use. 
Option 1 is used for generating artificial datasets. However, the datasets used in report is already included in the submission, and running option 1 will overwrite the exsisting datasets. So no need to run this option if the TA wants only to verify the results in report.
Option 2 is used for only evaluating the datasets produced by PCA. Evaluation includes calculating Trustworthiness, Continuity and Generalization Errors.
Option 3 is used for only evaluating the datasets produced by LLE. Evaluation includes calculating Trustworthiness, Continuity and Generalization Errors.
Option 4 is used for running everything from dataset generation to evaluation. This process, however, can take up to 8 hours depending on the speed of the machine.
